 CalorieCounterFrame creates the frame and components of the Calorie Counter app.
 
 to do:
 re-factor:
	- remove as much hardcoding as possible and try to make classes more
	  independent, similar to what is done in separation of concerns. For
	  example, rather than having CalorieCounter so heavily coupled with
	  the frame, create another independent class which will handle all data
	  saving and retrieving, then instantiate it directly into the frame
	  to set the values for the buttons. Like:
	  	DataHandler
		attributes:
			breakfast:Food
			lunch:Food
			dinner:Food
			snacks:Food
			total:Food
		methods:
			get/setBreakfast();
			get/setLunch();
			get/setDinner();
			get/setSnacks();
			getTotal();
			retrieveData();
			saveData();
			resetTotals();

 Try to re-create the inner class, instead of using anonymous class for parameter passing on each ActionListener:
      - Initial trouble: I had initially an inner class that took a Food object as parameter, however this didn't
      work, due to Java passing parameters as value, not reference. It was causing the Reset button to fail, for
      some reason. A solution might be to implement a reset() method within the ActionListener implementing class,
      but how would I then make sure that each object would refer to its respective variable on the CalorieCounter
      class?
 Add an option to save values by date;
 Add an option to add food titles to each meal;
 Add finishing to the layout;
