/**
 * CalorieCounterFrame creates the frame and components of the Calorie Counter app.
 * 
 * to do:
 * Add this to Eclipse
 * Try to re-create the inner class, instead of using anonymous class for parameter passing on each ActionListener:
 *      - Initial trouble: I had initially an inner class that took a Food object as parameter, however this didn't
 *      work, due to Java passing parameters as value, not reference. It was causing the Reset button to fail, for
 *      some reason. A solution might be to implement a reset() method within the ActionListener implementing class,
 *      but how would I then make sure that each object would refer to its respective variable on the CalorieCounter
 *      class?
 * Add an option to save values by date;
 * Add an option to add food titles to each meal;
 * Add finishing to the layout;
