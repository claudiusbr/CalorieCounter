Calorie Counter
===============

A simple program which keeps track of the number of calories entered by the user.

Requirements
------------
- There should be a facility to enter:
    - multiple users;
    - multiple dates.

- The program should record the number of calories for breakfast,
  lunch, dinner and snacks;

- It should display a running total of the calories consumed;

- It should save the calories whenever a new one is submitted;

- It should load the saved totals whenever it re-opens;

- The logic should be decoupled from the data in a way that the latter could be
  stored and loaded from a text file or a database without significant changes
  to the first.
