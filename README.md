Calorie Counter
===============

A simple program which keeps track of the number of calories entered by the
user. I am writing this more to try different things out than as anything
really useful.

Currently in the [planning stage](https://github.com/claudiusbr/CalorieCounter/tree/master/planning) of a [rewrite](https://github.com/claudiusbr/CalorieCounter/commit/4d4b20d9d458723497559bfdeeb791d2cd52eaa4).

What is needed to run it:
-------------------------
### Required
- Java 8
- Maven

### Optional
- IntelliJ
