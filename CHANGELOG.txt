/**
 * Simple Calorie Counter
 * 07/06/15 - v1: linear calorie counter (deleted);
 * 13/06/15 - v2: still linear; included inheritance and specialisation;
 * 14/06/15 - v3: changed from linear to multiple choice; Reduced number of subclasses and scrapped subclasses;
 * 24/06/15 - v4:  
 *  .1 - changed 'option' to string: trying to control exceptions by limiting value of  to characters '1,2,3,4' contained in a String;
 *  .2 - modified way of clearing totals from object references: now done by using the no argument constructor of class Food;
 *  .3 - array 'storage' no longer to be used to store values before saving. Printing values from instances of Food directly to save files instead.
 * 26/07/15 - v5: added GUI and modified app structure to accomodate a GUI.
